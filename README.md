This testing project was created to test the Microsoft website, using Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, JMeter, and TestNG.
The project aims to ensure the website is functioning correctly and that the user experience is satisfactory.
The project consists of several tests, each one focusing on different aspects of the website. Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver are used for basic UI tests, 
JMeter for performance tests, and TestNG for integration and end-to-end tests.

The project is designed to be easy to set up and use. Additionally, all of the tests are written in a way that makes them easy to maintain and update.
I hope this project will be helpful for anyone looking to test the Microsoft website, and that it will be a useful reference for other projects.
